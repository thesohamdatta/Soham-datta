# Soham Datta

**AI Researcher · Applied Machine Learning Engineer**  
Pune, India

I work on **human-centered AI systems** with a focus on  
**on-device intelligence, affective computing, and privacy-first ML**.

This GitHub is a living record of what I build, study, and test.

## Current Focus

### AURA — On-Device Emotional AI (Research Project)

A privacy-first emotional AI system designed to run **entirely offline**.

- Emotion detection from voice using CNN–LSTM
- Quantized models for low-power edge devices
- Local memory (no cloud, no telemetry)
- Optimized for low latency and constrained hardware

**Core research question:**  
Can emotionally aware AI exist without surveillance?

Status: Active research & prototyping

## Research & Academic Work

**Research Assistant — PES Modern College of Engineering**

- Co-authored an academic paper on *Information Literacy*
- Applied AI tools for document analysis and research workflows
- Digitized and structured 3,000+ academic records
- Supported 50+ students and faculty in adopting AI-driven tools

---

## Applied AI & Engineering Work

- Built multiple AI/ML prototypes across NLP, CV, and automation
- Computer vision systems (classification, detection, transfer learning)
- Edge deployment using TensorFlow Lite and ML Kit
- LLM-based systems (RAG, prompt pipelines, agent workflows)
- Workflow automation for real users (not demos)

Focus is consistently on **constraints, robustness, and usability**.
